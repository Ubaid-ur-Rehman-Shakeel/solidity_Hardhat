# Loops

In Solidity, a loop is a programming construct that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly while a certain condition is true. Solidity provides several types of loops, including the for loop, while loop, and do-while loop.

The most commonly used loop in Solidity is the for loop, which allows you to specify the number of iterations and increment/decrement in each iteration.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
