# In this step we are learning about Constructors

# Constructors
A constructor in Solidity is a special function that is used to initialize state variables in a contract. The constructor is called when an contract is first created and can be used to set initial values.




# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
