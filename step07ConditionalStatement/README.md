# Conditional Statement

In Solidity, a conditional statement is a programming construct that allows you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a certain condition is true or false. The two most common types of conditional statements in Solidity are the if statement and the ternary operator.

What is If-Else?
In Solidity, the if-else statement is a type of conditional statement that allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false. The syntax for an if-else statement in Solidity is similar to other programming languages.

What is Ternary operater?
In Solidity, the ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing a simple if-else statement. The ternary operator allows you to assign a value to a variable based on a condition.


# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
